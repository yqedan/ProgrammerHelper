          "question":"What’s the difference between an Abstract Class and Interface in Java?",
          "answer":"The primary difference between an abstract class and interface is that an interface can only possess declaration of public static methods with no concrete implementation while an abstract class can have members with any access specifiers (public, private etc) with or without concrete implementation. Another key difference in the use of abstract classes and interfaces is that a class which implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface while a class which inherits from an abstract class doesn’t require implementation of all the methods of its super class. A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class."

        {
          "question":"Can we override static methods of a class?",
          "answer":"We cannot override static methods.

          "question":"Can we call the constructor of a class more than once for an object?",
          "answer":"Constructor is called automatically when we create an object using new keyword. It’s called only once for an object at the time of object creation and hence, we can’t invoke the constructor again for an object after its creation."

          "question":"Can a variable be local and static at the same time?",
          "answer":"No a variable can’t be static as well as local at the same time. Defining a local variable as static gives compilation error."

          "question":"Can a class in Java be inherited from more than one class?",

        {
          "question":"Can variables be used in Java without initialization?",
          "answer":"In Java, if a variable is used in a code without prior initialization by a valid value, program doesn’t compile and gives an error as no default value is assigned to variables in Java."

          "question":"Can we call a non-static method from inside a static method?",
          "answer":"Non-Static methods are owned by objects of a class and have object level scope and in order to call the non-Static methods from a static block (like from a static main method), an object of the class needs to be created first. Then using object reference, these methods can be invoked."

          "question":"Can we use a default constructor of a class even if an explicit constructor is defined?",
          "answer":"Java provides a default no argument constructor if no explicit constructor is defined in a Java class. But if an explicit constructor has been defined, default constructor can’t be invoked and developer can use only those constructors which are defined in the class."

        {
          "question":" How can we use primitive data types as objects?",
          "answer":"Primitive data types like int can be handled as objects by the use of their respective wrapper classes. For example, Integer is a wrapper class for primitive data type int. We can apply different methods to a wrapper class, just like any other object."

        {
          "question":"What’s the benefit of using inheritance?",
          "answer":"Key benefit of using inheritance is reusability of code as inheritance enables sub-classes to reuse the code of its super class. Polymorphism (Extensibility ) is another great benefit which allow new functionality to be introduced without effecting existing derived classes."
